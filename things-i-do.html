            other things i like doing are writing creatively, learning japanese, and posting aesthetic instagram stories of good food. 
            i'm not sure if i can call myself a full-on foodie because i really just snap some low-effort photos on my deteriorating iphone, but multiple 
            friends and acquaintances have told me that they love watching my instagram stories, and this makes me happy, so i'll accept whatever label 
            that entails. 
            <br><br>
            in terms of japanese, i am taking japanese classes at MIT (the teachers are great btw) and also practice conversational listening and speaking 
            by binge watching old seasons of Terrace House. i enjoy the show (and also gain language-oriented educational value from it) but i have mixed feelings about the show 
            in light of the numerous problems that have surfaced in relation to it. to be honest, "problems" is probably a euphemism - 
            for those unfamiliar, you can read more about what happened with regards to the show online, but beware that it is kind of dark.
            <br><br>
            i took two writing classes this past school year, one at MIT and one at Harvard, and concluded that although writing is quite fun,
            it is also quite hard. kudos to all the writers out there that can read and reread and reread their manuscripts until their eyes fall out. 
            i, for one, cannot. but! writing is still cool. i put some of my less-embarrassing creations on the 
            <a href="writing">writing</a> tab if anyone's up for some depressing streams of consciousness.

        <div class="thingsido-section">
            in case anyone was wondering (although i highly doubt it), i also do other things not listed on this page, such as missing my morning alarms and overcooking shin ramen. it is my opinion that those things are less 
            interesting to people so i will not elaborate on them here.
